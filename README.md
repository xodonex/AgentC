# AgentC Toolkit

This repository contains the full source of the AgentC Toolkit, which
was developed as result of a
[master's thesis](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=1079).

The code predates JDK 1.5, and hence generics are not used. It does however
still compile and run with the latest JDK 1.8, and is provided here for historic
reference.
